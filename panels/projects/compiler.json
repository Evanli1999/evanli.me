    "description": "A compiler written in scala to parse a subset of scala, which forms a functional language as part of coursework for CS241e. Front end uses CYK parsing, and type-safety is implemented. Novel things like tail-recursive optimizations, closures and cheney garbage collection were difficult, but ultimately fun, to implement.",
