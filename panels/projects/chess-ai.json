    "description": "Chess engine and AI implemented in C++ - the approach similar to that of alpha-zero's self learning strategy. A convolutional neural network is first trained via reinforcement learning. This network is then used to set initial probabilities in a Monte-Carlo tree search, which is the ultimate deciding factor in the move the engine makes.",
