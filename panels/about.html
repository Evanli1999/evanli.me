                Hi! I'm currently in my second year of a Computer Science and Statistics double major at the University of Waterloo.
                Currently looking for internship opportunites for summer 2019 for a math/theory heavy software development position!
                <br>
                <br>
                I have industry experience in cloud integration and backend engineering, as well as a passion for C++ and Java. I've recently been exploring applied statistics and machine learning by building AIs for an assortment of games such as Chess and Tetris as well as doing an assortment of kernels and competitions on Kaggle! 
                <br><br>
                In my spare time I like to play contemporary jazz piano (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=116QHk9jNGI">think: Kapustin!</a>), badminton, competitive video games, and of course code.
