                Hi! I'm a third year Computer Science Student at the University Waterloo.
                <br> <br>
                I really enjoy working with data. In particular, I love the often blurred boundary between
                data science and engineering - the rigor of writing good production code is a really great
                contrast to the creativity of tackling problems with nothing but math and data.
                <br> <br>
                I also love working with C++ and contest programming questions - these respectively are  the
                rigor and creativity I mention above. Perhaps this is why my language of choice (when I'm not on
                a time crunch, of course) for these questions are C++.
                <br><br>
                In my spare time I like to play contemporary jazz piano (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=116QHk9jNGI">think: Kapustin!</a>), badminton, competitive video games, and of course code.
