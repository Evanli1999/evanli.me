            Hi! I'm currently in my second year of a Computer Science and Statistics double major at the University of Waterloo.
            <br>
            I have industry experience in cloud integration and backend engineering, as well as a passion for C++ and Java. I've recently been exploring applied statistics and machine learning by building AIs for an assortment of games such as Chess and Tetris as well as doing an assortment of kernels and competitions on Kaggle!
