        <p id="about" style="text-align:left; line-height:25px">I am a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. In particular, I have developed a good amount of experience with machine learning 
            and web development I have had many opportunities to explore machine learning 
            and technology such as NLP by analyzing datasets such as those on <a href="http://kaggle.com/evanli1999">Kaggle</a>. Notably, here is an analysis I did on the 
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/evanli1999/titanic-a-demo-of-pandas-and-scikit-learn">Titanic Dataset</a>, 
            where I achieve an 88% accuracy predicting which passengers survived the accident. 
            <br><br>
            I am a very independent and fast worker. The course of my many projects have required me to learn and apply a diverse set of skills without supervision or deadlines. 
            I have consistently achieved this time after time, as demonstrated by my projects and experience.
